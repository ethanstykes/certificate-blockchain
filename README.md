# certificate-blockchain

Tasks:

Test functions of the class for errors and bugs

Create API for transactions (issuing certificate), mining, and certificate validation

TBD

Points to remember: 

Make sure that our chain is upto date before sending certificates for verification (to find the right leader), and more importantly, while adding a new block (to add the block to the largest existing chain).
