# certificate-blockchain

Tasks:

Test API's and functions (https://app.getpostman.com/join-team?invite_code=85949b4751d9d7e0b0312ee6f25c05cd&ws=de5c5fe0-3b5a-4644-8cbf-c4b5a27d124c)

Look for #..(TASK) comments in the code 


Points to remember: 

Make sure that our chain is upto date before sending certificates for verification (to find the right leader), and more importantly, while adding a new block (to add the block to the largest existing chain).
Add these functionalities to back-end (verify chain and resolve conflicts by calling the corresponding API's before submitting the certificates/adding a new block)
