# certificate-blockchain

Tasks:

Test API's and functions (use Postman)

Look for #..(TASK) comments in the code 


Points to remember: 

Make sure that our chain is upto date before sending certificates for verification (to find the right leader), and more importantly, while adding a new block (to add the block to the largest existing chain).
Add these functionalities to back-end (verify chain and resolve conflicts by calling the corresponding API's before submitting the certificates/adding a new block)
